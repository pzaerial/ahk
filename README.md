# AHK
AutoHotkey scripts for various use cases.

General purpose scripts are in the root, and stuff that is specific to a use case is in a matching folder.

## Notes
Most of these were written with AHK v1 syntax, and some of the later ones were built with AHK v2. 
I didn't figure out how to do some things like ControlClick in AHK v2, so preferences are for AHK v1 for now.
